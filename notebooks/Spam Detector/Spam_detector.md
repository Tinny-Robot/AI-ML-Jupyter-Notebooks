# Text Classification with Scikit-Learn

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook demonstrating text classification using Python and scikit-learn. The code demonstrates a basic text classification task, where text is classified into two classes (e.g., spam vs. not spam). You can adapt this code to different classification tasks as needed.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: pandas, scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. **Prepare Your Own Dataset**:
   - Create or obtain your own dataset.
   - Save the dataset as `sample_data.csv` in the project directory.
   - Ensure the dataset has two columns: 'text' for the text data and 'label' for the class labels.

2. **Open and Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   - Open and run the `text_classification.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.
   - Customize the notebook for your specific dataset and classification task.
   
3. **Classify New Text**:
   - Use the `classify_text` function in the notebook to classify new text based on the trained model.

## Advanced Features

You can enhance this code with the following features:

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize the model's performance by tuning hyperparameters.

- **Cross-Validation**: Implement cross-validation for more robust evaluation.

- **Feature Engineering**: Experiment with different text preprocessing techniques, such as TF-IDF, word embeddings, or pre-trained language models.

- **Visualization**: Visualize model performance and data distributions using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn.

- **Error Analysis**: Understand common misclassifications made by the model to improve its accuracy.

- **Advanced Models**: Explore more advanced models like Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, or neural networks to improve classification performance.
